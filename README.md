Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (car_prediction_ml.ipynb) contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to predict car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more. The model helps users estimate the market value of a car using historical data and regression techniques.
